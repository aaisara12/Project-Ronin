# Project-Ronin
## Summary

Ronin is a fast-paced rogue-like that leverages detailed art and sound design to make the player feel like a legendary sword master developed. This project was developed in Unity and created in collaboration with 14 other students as part of UCLA ACM Studio's annual 20-week student-led game development projects. For those who'd like to try out the game, it can be found [here](https://aaisara12.itch.io/ronin)!
