Thank you for purchasing our asset! We hope you enjoy Lumen: Stylized Light Effects, and you find it useful.

To setup your project for the built-in render pipeline, ensure the color mode is set to linear and the PostProcessing V2 package is installed for best results.

For use with URP projects, import the URP .unitypackage (Distant Lands/Lumen/Custom Render Pipelines/Import for URP) and enable the depth texture in the URP settings. 


To create new light FX using Lumen, use the Distant Lands/Lumen menu item to create the light effect of your choice in the scene. 
Next, assign the dataset that you want to use on the Lumen component on your newly created effect or create a new dataset using the Create New Data button.
Finally, make any individual adjustments to the effect using the global settings for changes to all effects that use this data, and the local settings for changes that apply to the current effect only!

If you have any questions or issues, please contact us on our Discord (link in the asset page) or at distantlands.productions@gmail.com for support!
